# Sensory-Traits-PLR-Dynamics-GAMM
Dataset and code for our study on sensory processing traits and pupillary light reflex (PLR) dynamics. It includes 100Hz downsampled pupil time-series, AASP/AQ/ASRS scores, and R scripts for GAMM analysis (mgcv/itsadug). We used GAMMs to model non-linear PLR trajectories and trait-time interactions with AR(1) error structures.
